## üéØ My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid 
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ‚Äì React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) ‚Äì JS library
- [TanStack Query (FKA React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) ‚Äì Data fetching library
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - HTTP client
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äì For styles
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For form state management

### What I learned

This challenge was very interesting for me. It gave me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of Tanstack query v4 so that I can fetch data from external APIs in a more powerful way, especially by using the useQuery hooks together with the useIsFetching hook.

Also, this was the first time that I had used Tailwind CSS to implement a design, and I had also integrated Mapbox to enable the display of custom markers on online maps in precise coordinates, which is what makes this site unique.
